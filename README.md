# JavascriptCoding

Javascript coding is to get familiar with methods in javascript. 
I can go do a quick gothrough whenever I need some help. 
I am planning to add more and more small coding exercises in javascript.
Feel free to use this repo without any hesitation.
Please provide feedback if there is any correction needed.
